I am a senior mathematics major and Greek minor at Bowdoin College. My mathematical interests primarily lie in algebraic geometry, broadly construed. Right now I am interested in the application of "modern" techniques (eg. computation, motivic homotopy theory) to "classical" problems. I believe the synthesis of the ancient and modern is the paradigmatic example of the "long conversation" of mathematics.[^1] <br/>

In a previous life, I worked on problems in computational drug discovery. 

[^1]: "Mathematics is a long conversation" is a quote often attributed to Barry Mazur.
