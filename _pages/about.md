<blockquote>
  But when we note that mathematics has the manner of being of a lively forward movement from acquisitions as premises to new     
  acquisitions, in whose ontic meaning that of the premises is included (the process continuing in this manner), then it is clear that 
  the total meaning of geometry (as a developed science, as in the case of every science) could not have been present as a project and 
  then as mobile fulfillment at the beginning. (E. Husserl, <i> The Origin of Geometry </i>)

I am a current Master's student at the University of Bonn and a 2024 graduate of Bowdoin College. My mathematical interests primarily lie in algebraic geometry, in particular within categorical and algebro-topological methods. I also spend time thinking about nonlinear algebra and mathematical software.

In a previous life, I worked on problems in computational drug discovery.
