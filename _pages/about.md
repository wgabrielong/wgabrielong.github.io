I am a junior mathematics major and Greek minor at Bowdoin College. My mathematical interests primarily lie in algebraic geometry, broadly construed. Right now I am interested in the application of "modern" techniques (eg. computation) to "classical" problems. In a previous life, I worked on problems in computational drug discovery.
