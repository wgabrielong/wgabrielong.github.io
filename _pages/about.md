I am a senior mathematics major and Greek minor at Bowdoin College. My mathematical interests primarily lie in algebraic geometry, broadly construed. Right now I am interested in the application of modern techniques from both pure and applied mathematics to classical problems. I believe the synthesis of the ancient and modern exemplifies the grandeur of mathematics as a long conversation.<sup>1</sup>

In a previous life, I worked on problems in computational drug discovery. <br/><br/>
