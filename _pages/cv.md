<h2> A Longer Bio </h2>
I am an incoming [Mathematics Master's student](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/studium/en) at [The University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en). <br/>

I recently graduated [Bowdoin College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/) where I [majored in mathematics](https://www.bowdoin.edu/math/) and [minored in Ancient Greek](https://www.bowdoin.edu/classics/). During the course of my undergraduate education, I spent the 2020-2021 academic year on leave from Bowdoin where I conducted research at the [Karanicolas Lab](https://www.karanicolaslab.org/) of the [Fox Chase Cancer Center](https://www.foxchase.org/) developing machine learning tools for drug discovery. During this time I was also a visiting student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.columbia.edu/). I spent summer 2021 as an independent contributor at [The Xena Project](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/) of the [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and worked on the formalization of mathematics in the Lean theorem prover, writing proofs for the [MathLib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html) .  <br/>

Returning to Bowdoin for the 2021-2022 academic year, I spent summer 2022 at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig as a visiting researcher in [Paul Breiding's Emmy Noether Group](https://pbrdng.github.io) where I worked on a project at the interface of enumerative and real algebraic geometry. <br/>

I spent the Fall of 2023 as a visiting student at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu) where, among other things, I learned about infinity categories and [gold and silver production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysopoeia).<br/>

I remain active in mathematics research and am currently working on problems in applied algebraic geometry and A1-enumerative geometry.<br/>

Prior to Bowdoin, I grew up in South East Asia, and attended [Mont' Kiara International School](https://www.mkis.edu.my) in Kuala Lumpur. 

A public version of my vita is available [here](https://wgabrielong.github.io/files/Wern_Juin_Gabriel_Ong___CV__Public_.pdf) and my full vita is available on request. <br/><br/>

<h2> Fun Facts </h2>

In my spare time I enjoy reading texts in Ancient Greek, especially philosophy and tragic theater. <br/>

If I was a Springer Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Saunders Mac Lane's <i>Categories for the Working Mathematician</i>. Find out what Springer Graduate Text in Mathematics you are at the following [link](https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html).
