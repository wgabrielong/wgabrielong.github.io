<h2> A Longer Bio </h2>
I am a [Mathematics Master's student](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/studium/en) at [The University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en). <br/>

I graduated from [Bowdoin College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/) in 2024 where I [majored in mathematics](https://www.bowdoin.edu/math/) and [minored in Ancient Greek](https://www.bowdoin.edu/classics/). During the course of my undergraduate career, I had the great privilege to spend time conducting research at the [Karanicolas Lab](https://www.karanicolaslab.org/) of the [Fox Chase Cancer Center](https://www.foxchase.org/), [The Xena Project](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/) of the [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), and [Paul Breiding's Emmy Noether Group](https://pbrdng.github.io) at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/), as well as a visiting student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) and [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu). <br/>

Prior to Bowdoin, I grew up in South East Asia, and attended [Mont' Kiara International School](https://www.mkis.edu.my) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

A public version of my vita is available [here](https://wgabrielong.github.io/files/Wern_Juin_Gabriel_Ong___CV__Public_.pdf) and my full vita is available on request. <br/><br/>

<h2> Fun Facts </h2>

In my spare time I enjoy reading texts in Ancient Greek, especially philosophy and tragic theater. Check out the [Catherine Project](https://catherineproject.org/).<br/>

If I was a Springer Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Saunders Mac Lane's <i>Categories for the Working Mathematician</i>. Find out what Springer Graduate Text in Mathematics you are at the following [link](https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html).
