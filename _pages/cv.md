I am a senior [mathematics major](https://www.bowdoin.edu/math/) and a [Greek minor](https://www.bowdoin.edu/classics/) at [Bowdoin College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/). <br/>

Before Bowdoin, I went to high school in Kuala Lumpur where I graduated from [Mont' Kiara International School](https://www.mkis.edu.my/) in 2019. <br/>

I spent the 2020-2021 academic year on leave from Bowdoin during which I conducted research at the [Karanicolas Lab](https://www.karanicolaslab.org/) of the [Fox Chase Cancer Center](https://www.foxchase.org/) developing machine learning tools for drug discovery. During this time I was also a visiting student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.columbia.edu/). I spent summer 2021 as an independent contributor at [The Xena Project](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/) of the [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and worked on the formalization of mathematics in the Lean theorem prover, writing proofs for the [MathLib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html) .  <br/>

I spent summer 2022 at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig as a visiting researcher in the [Emmy Noether Group - Numerical and Probabalistic Nonlinear Algera](https://www.mis.mpg.de/breiding/index.html) where I worked on a project at the interface of enumarative and real algebraic geometry. <br/>

This coming summer, I will be based at the [University of Massachusetts - Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/) working on a research project in algebraic geometry under the supervision of [Jenia Tevelev](https://people.math.umass.edu/~tevelev/). <br/>

This coming fall, I will be a visiting student at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/).<br/>

In my spare time I enjoy reading texts in Ancient Greeek, especially philosophy and tragic theater. <br/>

A public version of my vita is availible [here](https://wgabrielong.github.io/files/Wern_Juin_Gabriel_Ong___CV__Public_.pdf) and my full vita is available on request.
