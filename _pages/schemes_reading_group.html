Algebraic geometry, classically understood, is the study of multivariate polynomials and their vanishing loci known as varieties.  A more modern view, introduced by Grothendieck in the latter half of the 20th century, reformulated algebraic geometry as the study of schemes. The language of schemes has since come to be universally accepted because of its advantages in both technical simplicity and conceptual clarity over the classical theory of varieties.

We will work through Ravi Vakil's text <i> The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry </i> [<a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGaug2922publici.pdf">Version of September 2022</a>]
<br><br>
Doing a "serious reading" of an algebraic geometry text involves doing many exercies. I have written up my exercies on the following [<a href="/classes/schemes_reading_group/solutions">page</a>].
