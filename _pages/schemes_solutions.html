It is apocryphally said <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> that to learn algebraic geometry well, one must do many exercies. This is my attempt at that. I also want to make my (at best middling) solutions online, yet not make it such that the material is easily obtainable <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. Inspired by <a href="https://stanford.edu/~dkim04/posts/solving-hartshorne-exercises/">Dongryul Kim</a>'s "imperfect encryption scheme" which he implemented for his solution compendium for the exercies in the middle chapters of Hartshorne's text. Each solution is on a separate file AXX where XX is some length 2 string of capital alphabets. There is a file uploaded for each of the 26 x 26 = 676 files but only a fraction of them will be actual solutions. Feel free to email if you have any suggested improvements to my solutions, or if you wish to request one particular solution.
