It is apocryphally said 
<fn> Really one need only look [<a href="https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html">here</a>], [<a href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~ellenber/gradstudents.html">here</a>], and [<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/comment-page-1/#comment-32483">here</a>]</fn> 
that to learn algebraic geometry well, one must do many exercies. This is my attempt at that. I also want to make my (at best middling) solutions online, yet not make it such that the material is easily obtainable.
<fn> Indeed Vakil himself says as much in personal correspondence with Math StackExchange user Zev Chonoles. See [<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/598018/solutions-to-vakil-foundations-of-algebraic-geometry-exercises">here</a>] </fn>
Inspired by <a href="https://stanford.edu/~dkim04/posts/solving-hartshorne-exercises/">Dongryul Kim</a>'s "imperfect encryption scheme", the solutions are availible at the following link where XXXX is an alphanumeric key of length 4.
