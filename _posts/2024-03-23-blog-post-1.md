I've been meaning to start a blog for some time, and nothing like the idleness of a power outage in the wake of a winter storm to actually get me cracking on this. [^1] There isn't a specific goal for this blog, just a plan to write about things that are intersting to me. There'll definitely be some math in there, maybe some writing about _doing math_ too. Hopefully there will be something for everyone.
